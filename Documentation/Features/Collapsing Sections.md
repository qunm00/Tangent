Sections of text within a note can be collapsed, hiding their content below their parent. This works for [[Headers]], [[Lists]], [[Code]] and [[KaTeX Equations|Math]], and [[Front Matter]]. Simply hover over a parent line and click on the collapse caret that appears in the left margin.

A note's collapsed sate is saved and restored whenever you go back to that file.

You can toggle the collapsed state of the section where your cursor currently is with the `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Enter` shortcut.

The `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+<` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+>` shortcuts will collapsed and reveal, respectively, the smallest and largest sections as appropriate. This can be used to quickly roll up or unfold a large document in steps.

The `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift+<` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift+>` shortcuts will collapse & expand all sections, respectively.
